This is the GitHub account that I created for CTI 110 - 0001 class

This is my first repository as I have never used a program like GitHub before. I normally just save diffeent version of my code files deactivate lines by marking them as comments. It is not a very efficient method but has worked so far.

In order to clone my repository I first downloaded the desktop version of GitHub and installed to my computer. Once installed, I was able to log into my account. I clicked on the "File" tab and selected "clone repository".
