        <p>
            I currently with at the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer and I have returned to school after a 20 year absence in order to acquire new skills and hopefully a new career path. In my spare time I carve wood, book bind, and tool leather. I have also been playing Dungeons & Dragons for over 30 years.
